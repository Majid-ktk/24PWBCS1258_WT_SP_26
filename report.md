# Lab 01 – Reflection

In this lab, I learned how to set up VS Code and configure Git for version control.  
I practiced creating files, committing changes, and pushing them to GitHub.  
I also learned how to create branches, make experimental changes, and merge them back into the main branch.  
Finally, I gained experience in documenting my workflow using Markdown.  
This lab helped me understand basic Git operations and collaborative development.
